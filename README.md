# 👋 Welcome to 0xLandQ  

🌍 **0xLandQ** is building the future of **decentralized land ownership, verification, and lending** system powered by blockchain.  
We’re bridging **real-world assets (RWA)** with on-chain infrastructure to make land more transparent, verifiable, and accessible.  

---

## 🔭 What we’re working on
- **LandNFT** → Minting verifiable land parcels as NFTs with geo-coordinates, country/state metadata, and supporting documents.  
- **LandVerifier** → Smart contract registry for agencies to verify land records per jurisdiction.  
- **LandLending** → Unlocking liquidity from LandNFTs via collateralized lending powered by Pyth-based price feeds.  
- **Frontend dApp** → Interactive map-based interface for minting, verifying, and leveraging land on-chain.  

---

## 🌱 What we’re learning
- Advanced **RWA tokenization** standards  
- Integration with **CoreDAO** ecosystem  
- Scalable decentralized storage with **Pinata/IPFS**  
- Cross-chain interoperability & oracles  

---

## 👯 We’re looking to collaborate on
- dApp frontend development (Next.js, wagmi, ethers)  
- Smart contract auditing & security reviews  
- Partnerships with agencies/organizations in the land registry space  
- CoreDAO ecosystem integrations & hackathon collaborations  

---

## 🤔 We’re looking for help with
- Improving land metadata standards for NFTs  
- Designing scalable verification mechanisms with trusted agencies  
- Exploring DeFi use-cases around land-backed lending
